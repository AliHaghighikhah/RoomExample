# RoomExample
this is a toturial for Room library and this Architecture



## What we will build

You will build an app that uses Android Architecture Components and implements the architecture from Guide to App Architecture for these components. The sample app stores a list of words in a Room database and displays it in a RecyclerView. The app is bare bones but sufficiently complex that you can use it as a template to build upon.

In this codelab you build an app that does the following:
- Works with a database to get and save the data, and pre-populates the database with some words.
- Displays all the words in a RecyclerView in MainActivity.
- Opens a second activity when the user taps the + button. When the user enters a word, adds the word to the database and the list.

## What you'll learn
**How to design and construct an app using the Architecture Components Room and Lifecycles libraries.**

There are a lot of steps to using the Architecture Components and implementing the recommended architecture. The most important thing is to create a mental model of what is going on, and understand how the pieces fit together and how the data flows. As you work through this codelab, don't just copy and paste the code, but try to start building that inner understanding.


for lear this toturial you must know these knowledge :

- **RecyclerView and adapters.**


- **SQLite database and the SQLite query language.**


- **Threading and AsyncTask.**
