for lear this toturial you must know these knowledge

RecyclerView and adapters
SQLite database and the SQLite query language

**What we will build**

You will build an app that uses Android Architecture Components and implements the architecture from Guide to App Architecture for these components. The sample app stores a list of words in a Room database and displays it in a RecyclerView. The app is bare bones but sufficiently complex that you can use it as a template to build upon.
